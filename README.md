# nayland
Nayland is a library which provides high-level, ergonomic, memory safe* wrappers to the libwayland library's client API.

It aims to make it easier to write Wayland clients in Nim.

# notes
- It is still a heavy work-in-progress.
- This library does not plan to build a high-level windowing abstraction on top of Wayland! It simply provides low-level wrappers over Wayland interfaces.

## generating protocol wrappers
`protocols/bindgen.nim` is your best friend for this. It can take in a `.xml` file, and integrate bindings for it inside `src/nayland/bindings/protocols/`, including private C code.

# installation
You can get Neo [here](https://github.com/xTrayambak/neo). I do not test the Nimble manifest, and I have no plans to provide support for it.

## Neo (recommended)
Inside your project directory, run:
```
$ neo add gh:xTrayambak/nayland
```

## Nimble (NOT RECOMMENDED)
Inside your project directory, run:
```
$ nimble add https://github.com/xTrayambak/nayland
```
